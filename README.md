Data Normalization:

Data normalization is the process of taking one's data model and its attributes and organizing them 
in such a way that it will reduce the redundancy and improve the integrity of the data. There are four
forms of data normalization; First Normal Form(1NF), Second Normal Form(2NF), Third Normal Form(3NF),
and Boyce and Codd Normal Form(BCNF). The benefits of having data that is highly normalized is that 
data will be stored in a single place, decreasing the inconsistency of the data. Also normalization 
makes it easier to understand the relationships in your data.

Graphs and Graph Databases:

A graph is a data structure consisting of a set of vetices(nodes) and a set of pairings known as edges.
Graphs can come in many forms, directed, undirected, cyclic, etc, so they can fulfill a vast number
of requirements. A graph database is a type of NoSQL database that implements the concepts of graph
theory to store, map, and query relationships. Graph databases allow for highly connected data as 
well as having more complex queries, while maintaining speed. In graph databases nodes can support
any number of relationships without having to sacrifice performance of the data model.

Groovy:

Groovy is a dynamic object-oriented language for the Java Virtual Machine. It has similar features 
to other programming languages such as Python, Ruby, and Perl. It is a compiled language that is 
excuted by the Java Virtual Machine, meaning it can be run anywhere Java is used, giving it great
flexibility. With its usage as a scripting language and it's Java like syntax, it serve as a tool
for introducing developers to a scripting language.

CouchDB:

CouchDB is an open source document-oriented NoSQL database. Being document based is does not store
relationships in a table like relational databases do, but instead use collections of JSON documents.
One of the more exciting features of CouchDB is that the database does not lock the database during writes
so access is all the more free. Also with it's clusted nature, CouchDB makes user data avaialable
through many different methods.
