Data Normalization:

Data normalization is the process of taking one's data model and its attributes and organizing them 
in such a way that it will reduce the redundancy and improve the integrity of the data. There are four
forms of data normalization; First Normal Form(1NF), Second Normal Form(2NF), Third Normal Form(3NF),
and Boyce and Codd Normal Form(BCNF). The benefits of having data that is highly normalized is that 
data will be stored in a single place, decreasing the inconsistency of the data. Also normalization 
makes it easier to understand the relationships in your data.
